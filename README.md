This is a repository for an event held by Informatics Student Association of Institut Sains dan Teknologi Terpadu Surabaya (ISTTS)
Holiday Camp was a program that we arrange to teach other students how to create a simple 2D game.
It was open to Senior High School students across Indonesia. In this event, we provided the students information and
clear instructions on how to make a seamless 2D game.

We use a Game Engine called GDevelop which was an open source and free software to develop 2D game.
The program is very user friendly and easy to learn. Without any knowledge of programming language, you
can make a simple platformer game. The software also provides other types of game like top-down and shooting.
