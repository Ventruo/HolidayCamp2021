<h1>Holiday Camp 2021</h1>


This is a repository for an event held by Informatics Student Association of Institut Sains dan Teknologi Terpadu Surabaya (ISTTS). <br>
Holiday Camp was a program that we arrange to teach other students how to create a simple 2D game.
It was open to Senior High School students across Indonesia. In this event, we provided the students information and
clear instructions on how to make a seamless 2D game.

We use a Game Engine called GDevelop which was an open source and free software to develop 2D game. <br>
The program is very user friendly and easy to learn. Without any knowledge of programming language, you <br>
can make a simple platformer game. The software also provides other types of game like top-down and shooting. <br>
